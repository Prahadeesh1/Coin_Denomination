# Coin Denomination Optimization – Dynamic Programming

## Problem
Computing the minimum number of coins to reach a target amount efficiently.

## Approach
Implemented:
- Greedy baseline approach
- Dynamic programming optimization

## Complexity
- Greedy: O(n)
- DP: O(n * amount)

## Benchmark Results
DP guarantees optimality vs Greedy failures in cases like denominations: [1,3,4].

## Lessons Learned
Understanding optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
